      years: Oct 2021 - Jan 2024
      description: "Completed my Masters Degree in Computer Science at ETH Zürich (5.4/6 CGPA), with a major in Machine Intelligence and a Minor in Data Management Systems. Though it was my first foray into Atrificial Intelligence, I've been constantly learning more about this field by studying different courses and working on various projects hands on. Equally interesting I've always studied different systems for the management of data from cloud based systems to large scalable storage and processing systems like hadoop and spark. Here are some of the projects I've worked on:"
